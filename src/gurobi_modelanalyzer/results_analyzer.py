    will be used, computing the factorization if needed.   If no statuses
    are available, solve the LP to optimality (or whatever the final
    solve status is) and use that basis.

    Arguments:
    model      (required) The LP model whose basis will be examined.
                          Basis can be from a completed solve or statuses.
                          LP will be optimized if no basis present
    data                  Do not provide.  Used only for Gurobi routines.
    KappaExact (optional) 1 = display exact condition number in stats
                          0 = display less computationally intensive estimate
                         -1 = (default) decide based on problem size.
    prmfile    (optional) Parameter settings file for the subproblem
                          solved to derive the ill conditioning certificate.
    relobjtype (optional) Type of subproblem to create for calculation of
                          ill conditioning certificate.
                          "LP" (default)
                          "QP"
    expltype   (optional) Row ("ROWS") or column ("COLS") based computation
                          and explanation. Default is by row.  One type of
                          explanation is often much smaller than the other.
    method     (optional) Alternate computation methods (may help generate
                          smaller explanation).
                          "DEFAULT" = Basic subproblem (no regularization).
                          "ANGLES"  = Simpler calculation based on inner
                                      products.  Potentially faster but only
                                      finds explanations of 2 rows or
                                      columns.
                          "LASSO"   = One norm regularization.
                          "RLS"     = Two norm regularization.
    smalltol   (optional) Tolerance below which certificate of ill
                          conditioning values are treated as zero.   If
                          left at default of 1e-13, row or column norm and
                          machine precision will be incorporated.
    submatrix  (optional) Whether to postprocess the explanation down to
                          a smaller submatrix.  Default is False.
    Returns:              For all method settings except ANGLES, returns
                          the model that consists of the explanation.
                          If the method is ANGLES, returns a list of tuples

#   are almost parallel as well, i.e., the angle is close to 180 degrees.
#   The howmany parameter controls how many near parallel items to report.

    """Specialized ill conditioning explainer for finding pairs of near

    Any basis statuses, in the model will be used, computing the
    factorization if needed.  If no statuses are available, solve the LP
    to optimality (or whatever the final solve status is), and use
    that basis.

    Arguments:
    model      (required) The LP model whose basis will be examined.
                          Basis can be from completed solve or statuses.
                          LP will be optimized if no basis is present.
    howmany    (optional) Number of pairs of near parallel rows and columns
                          to search for.  Default is 1.  Specify a positive
                          integer for a particular number of pairs.
                          Specify an integer <= 0 to request all pairs.
                          Routine searches rows first, then columns.
    partol     (optional) Tolerance below which two row or column vectors
                          are considered almost parallel.  Used as a
                          relative tolerance when comparing the inner
