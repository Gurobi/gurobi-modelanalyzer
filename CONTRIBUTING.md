# Contributing to Gurobi

Welcome to Gurobi Model Analyzer

We value your experience in using Gurobi Model Analyzer and would
like to encourage you to contribute directly to this project.

## How to report bugs or submit feature requests If you encounter a
bug, or you think there is a need for a new feature, we recommend to
first add the bug report or feature request to the Gurobi Model
Analyzer [GitHub issue
tracker](https://github.com/Gurobi/gurobi-modelanalyzer/issues).

It would be great if you add a minimal reproducible example when
reporting a bug, or include reasoning on how the new requested feature
improves the code.

## Submitting changes We welcome external contributions to Gurobi
Model Analyzer.  Note that all contributors should accept the
[Contributor License Agreement
(CLA)](https://gist.github.com/mattmilten/d1c9640d79bde0ece8c2f46152639011).

To contribute code you should use the GitHub pull request
workflow. Once your pull request is ready for review, one of the core
maintainers of Gurobi Model Analyzer will review your pull request.

A pull request should contain tests for the changes made to the code
behavior, should include a clear message outlining the changes done,
and should be linked to an existing issue.

Before submitting a pull request:
- install the [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com) package to enable the automatic
  running of the pre-commit hooks in the `.pre-commit-configuration.yaml` file,
- make sure all tests pass by running `tox` in the root folder of the `gurobi_modelanalyzer`.
- add any other relevant checks for your changes to Gurobi Model Analyzer.

After a pull request is submitted, tests will be run, and the status
will appear on the pull request page. If the tests failed, there is a link which can be used to debug the failed tests.

## Code reviews
The pull request author should respond to all comments received. If the
comment has been accepted and appropriate changes applied, the author should respond by
a short message such as "Done" and then resolve the comment. If more discussion is
needed on a comment, it should remain open until a solution can be figured out.

## Merging changes
The core maintainer that reviewed the pull request will merge it after all comments have been addressed and when all tests are passing.

## Release process

We use github releases and actions to publish to PyPI. Currently, all releases are built from the main branch. To release version `X.Y.Z`:

1. Ensure `src/gurobi_modelanalyzer/__init__.py` on branch `main` contains `__version__ = "X.Y.Z"`
2. Go to Releases -> [Draft a new release](https://github.com/Gurobi/gurobi-modelanalyzer/releases/new) in GitHub
    - In "Choose a tag", create a new tag "vX.Y.Z"
    - Target should be 'main'
    - Set the release title as "Release vX.Y.Z"
    - Click "Generate release notes" to populate this automatically from merged pull request information, add any other notes if needed
    - Check "Set as the latest release"
    - Click "Publish release"
3. The [release job](https://github.com/Gurobi/gurobi-modelanalyzer/actions/workflows/release.yml) runs automatically
